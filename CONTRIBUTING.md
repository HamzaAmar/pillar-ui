## Style Guide

Pillar follows strict design and coding standards for consistency and maintainability.

### Component Class Naming Convention

We use a BEM-like convention adapted for scalability:

- **Folder prefixes**: Use the first two letters of the folder name. If a conflict arises, add a third distinguishing letter.
  - `table` ‚Üí `ta-`
  - `tabs` ‚Üí `tab-`
- **Elements**: Capitalize the first letter.
  - `row` ‚Üí `ta-R`
  - `item` ‚Üí `ta-I`
- **Modifiers**: Use `_` + the modifier name.
  - `fluid` ‚Üí `ta_fluid`
  - `inline` ‚Üí `ta_inline`

---

### Utility Class Naming Convention

Utility classes follow a file‚Äìproperty‚Äìvalue pattern to keep them distinct and traceable.

#### Format

- **File Initial**:
  - `alignment.css` ‚Üí `A`
  - `font.css` ‚Üí `F`
- **Property**:
  - `justify-content` ‚Üí `jc`
  - `font-style` ‚Üí `st` _(`F` is already used for file, so we add `t`)_
- **Value**:
  - `flex-start` ‚Üí `start`
  - `italic` ‚Üí `italic`

---

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistency**:  
   Use the same prefix and naming structure across all components.
2. **Scalability**:  
   Use camelCase for sub-elements to ensure readability.
3. **Separation of Concerns**:  
   Keep base classes, sub-elements, and modifiers distinct.  
   Use modifiers only when necessary.

---

### Why This Naming Convention?

- ‚ö° **Lightweight**: Minimizes CSS file size for better performance and LCP.
- üîç **Traceable**: Utility classes are easy to identify and debug.
- üîß **Clear purpose**: Each class clearly represents a property and value.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainable**: Keeps the system consistent as it grows.
