## RTL Support

We understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users who prefer right-to-left (RTL) languages. Pillar UI now includes RTL support, allowing you to easily create applications that cater to RTL language users.

### User Preference Detection

Pillar UI includes a user preference detection mechanism that automatically detects the user's preference for RTL mode based on their system or browser settings. If the user has set their preference to RTL mode, Pillar UI will make RTL mode the default appearance when the application loads.

### Enabling RTL Mode

To enable RTL mode in your Pillar UI application, you can use the `useDirection` custom hook from the `pillar-ui/hooks` library. This hook provides a simple way to toggle between RTL and LTR modes. Here's how you can add the RTL mode toggle functionality:

1. Install the `pillar-ui/hooks` library:

```bash
npm install @pillar-ui/hooks
```

2. Import the `useDirection` hook in your component:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useDirection } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'
import { Button } from '@pillar-ui/core'

const App = () => {
  const { isRtl, toggleDirection } = useDirection()

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={toggleDirection}>Toggle RTL Mode</Button>
      <p>Current mode: {isRtl ? 'RTL' : 'LTR'}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

In the code above, we import the `useDirection` hook from the `pillar-ui/hooks` library. We then use this hook to set the `isRtl` state variable and `toggleDirection` function in our component. The `isRtl` state variable holds the current mode (RTL or LTR), and the `toggleDirection` function allows us to toggle between RTL and LTR modes.

By using the `useDirection` custom hook from the `pillar-ui/hooks` library, you can easily add RTL mode functionality to your Pillar UI application. The hook handles the toggling of the mode, and you can customize the appearance of your components in RTL mode by modifying the CSS styles.

Please note that the compatibility of RTL mode in Pillar UI depends on the browser's support for CSS variables and media queries. It is recommended to test RTL mode in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

With Pillar UI's RTL support and the `useDirection` custom hook, you can provide a seamless experience for users who prefer RTL languages in your web applications.
