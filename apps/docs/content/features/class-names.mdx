# Shared CSS Classes in Pillar

## Introduction

At Pillar, performance is our top priority. To achieve this, we've designed our library with a focus on minimizing bundle size while maintaining readability and ease of use for both maintainers and users. One of the key strategies we've employed is the use tiny classNames. This approach not only keeps our bundle size small but also reduces style conflicts with users own classNames.

## Class Names and Shared Styles

The Pillar project offers a variety of CSS classes that can be used across different parts of your application.While we encourage the use of components for complex styling and functionality for better user experience, sometimes it is not practical to use a component for a simple use case. In such scenarios, adding CSS class names is a good practice and prevents you from adding multiple components or using heavy styles.

## Naming Convention

We simplify our utility classNames into three clear categories:

1. **File**: The file where the class is defined, such as `_spacing.css`, `_alignment.css`, or `_font.css`.
2. **Property**: The CSS property the class represents, like `margin`, `padding-top`, or `justify-content`.
3. **Modifier**: A value or variation applied to the property, such as `1`, `2`, `end`, `center`, or `uppercase`.

### Example

To understand how this works, let’s dissect `Smt-9`:

- **File**: This belongs to `_spacing.css`, as it’s related to spacing utilities.
- **Property**: The `Smt` prefix stands for "Spacing Margin Top," representing the `margin-top` property.
- **Modifier**: The `9` at the end specifies a predefined value for the `margin-top`.

## Classes By File

## Spacing

#### Margin
