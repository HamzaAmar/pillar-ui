## Pillar UI Accessibility Guide

Welcome to the Pillar UI Accessibility Guide! We are thrilled to introduce you to the accessibility enhancements built into our components. With Pillar UI, creating an inclusive user experience is straightforward and hassle-free.

### Our Commitment to Accessibility and User Feedback

At Pillar UI, we are deeply committed to ensuring that our components are accessible to all users. Accessibility is at the forefront of our development process, and we strive to create a library that is inclusive and user-friendly.

We believe that accessibility is an ongoing journey, and we continuously work to improve and enhance the accessibility of our components. We adhere to international accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), to ensure that our components meet the highest accessibility standards.

However, we understand that no system is perfect, and we value feedback from our users. If you encounter any accessibility issues or have suggestions for improving accessibility within our components, we encourage you to reach out to us. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us identify and address any areas of improvement. We are always listening and committed to making necessary adjustments to enhance the accessibility experience for all users.

Please feel free to contact our support team or submit an issue on our GitHub repository to provide feedback or report any accessibility concerns. We appreciate your collaboration in making the web a more inclusive space for everyone.

Together, let's build a more accessible future.

### Key Accessibility Features

When you work with Pillar UI, you automatically benefit from a range of accessibility features. Let's explore some of them:

#### 1. Semantic HTML

We use Semantic HTML, which means using appropriate HTML tags for their intended purpose. This improves the accessibility of our components, making it easier for browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies to understand and navigate the content. This ensures that users with visual impairments can effectively use your application.

#### 2. Windows High Contrast Mode

Our components seamlessly adapt to Windows High Contrast Mode. This ensures that your application remains legible for users with visual impairments, without any additional configuration.

#### 3. Reduced Motion Support

Some users are sensitive to motion. With Pillar UI, animations are adjusted based on the prefers-reduced-motion media query. This provides a comfortable experience for users who prefer minimal motion.

#### 4. ARIA Attributes

Our components come with built-in Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes. These attributes help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the functionality of our components, ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### 5. Color Contrast

We meticulously design our components to meet color contrast standards set by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This ensures clear visibility and legibility for all users.

#### 6. Keyboard Navigation

Pillar UI components are designed with keyboard navigation in mind. They follow best practices to ensure that users can easily interact with your application using only the keyboard.

#### 7. Typography

We prioritize accessibility in our typography design. Our typography is crafted to ensure clear readability in different environments and for users with varying visual abilities. This results in an optimal reading experience for all users.

#### 8. Color Accessibility

We recognize that color-blindness is a common condition, and we don't solely rely on color to convey information. Our components are designed with clear visual cues, contrasts, and additional indicators to ensure that users can understand and interact with the interface, regardless of their ability to perceive certain colors.

### Testing and Tools

We rigorously test our components for accessibility using manual and automated methods. This includes using assistive technologies like screen readers and accessibility testing tools such as WAVE and Lighthouse. We recommend using these tools to verify the accessibility of your application.

### Accessibility Guidelines and Standards

Pillar UI components are designed and developed following international accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This ensures that our components provide an accessible user experience that meets globally recognized standards.

### Conclusion

At Pillar UI, we prioritize accessibility to create an inclusive digital experience for all users. Our components seamlessly incorporate features like Windows High Contrast Mode compatibility, reduced motion support, ARIA attributes, color contrast adherence, keyboard navigation, and accessible typography. By choosing Pillar UI, you ensure that your application is accessible without requiring extra effort on your part.

If you have any questions or need assistance regarding accessibility, our support team is here to help you. Together, we contribute to making the web more accessible for everyone.
