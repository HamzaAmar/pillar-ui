## Installation

To start using Pillar in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

1. Create a new project or navigate to your existing project directory in the terminal.

1. Install one or more of Pillar Packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @pillar-ui/core
```

or you prefer Yarn

```bash
yarn add @pillar-ui/core
```

1. You can also install the other packages that Pillar support to make the proccess for making you site faster and simple

```bash
npm install @pillar-ui/hooks @pillar-ui/utilities @pillar-ui/icons
```

or You prefer Yarn

```bash
yarn add @pillar-ui/hooks @pillar-ui/utilities @pillar-ui/icons
```

## Adding Styles

To enhance the appearance and maintain visual consistency of your Vite React app using Pillar components, follow these steps to add the necessary styles. Pillar provides a CSS file that not only enhances the styling but also introduces additional features such as dark mode support and right-to-left (RTL) language support.

- Open the root file of your Remix app project.

- Locate the file where your app is initialized app/root.tsx

- Import the Pillar CSS file by adding the following import statement at the top of the file:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
// ...
import styles from '@pillar-ui/core/main.css'
// styles is now something like /build/global-AE33KB2.css

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles }]
}
```

## Customize the theming

With Pillar UI, you can easily customize the appearance of your user interface (UI) to match your preferences. By modifying the predefined custom properties, you can control colors, typography, spacing, and more.

To change the primary color of your UI, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a file named `theme.css`.
1. Inside `theme.css`, define the desired primary color using the --primary-color custom property. For example:

```css title="theme.css"
:root {
  --primary-1: hsl(225deg 60% 99.4%);
  --primary-2: hsl(223deg 100% 98.6%);
  /* ... */
  --primary-11: hsl(226deg 55% 45%);
  --primary-12: hsl(226dg 62% 17%);
}

.dark {
  --primary-1: hsl(229deg 24% 10%);
  --primary-2: hsl(230deg 36.4% 12.9%);
  /* ... */
  --primary-11: hsl(228deg 100% 75.9%);
  --primary-12: hsl(226deg 8% 96.3%);
}
```

1. Save the theme.css file.

1. Import the theme.css file in your project, making sure to import it after the `@pillar-ui/core/style` import. This ensures that your custom styles override the default styles provided by Pillar UI. For example:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
import globals from '@pillar-ui/core/style'
import themes from './theme.css'

export function links() {
  return [
    { rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles },
    { rel: 'stylesheet', href: themes },
  ]
}
```

By following these steps, you can easily personalize the primary color of your UI to your preferred choice. Feel free to explore other customization options such as font size, shadows, gradients, and spacing, which can be adjusted using similar custom properties.

Pillar UI empowers you to create a visually appealing UI that aligns with your project requirements and brand identity. Enjoy the flexibility and control over your UI's appearance with Pillar UI's customization capabilities.

## Developer experience

Pillar UI enhances your development experience (DX) with simple workflows for component implementation and customization. It eliminates repetitive styling code and offers customization options to fit your project requirements.

- Responsive Variables: Control component appearance easily with responsive variables.
- Preventing Repetition: Avoid repetitive styling by using predefined styles and variables.
- Customization and Extensibility: Customize Pillar UI to match your project's design language and branding.

```css
/*
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  Theme Section
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
*/

/*  Define custom theme styles here */

/*
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  Default Properties Section
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
*/

:root {
  --button-corner: 0;
  --avatar-corner: 0;
  --badge-corner: 0;
}
```

Set `--button-corner`, `--avatar-corner`, and `--badge-corner` to 0 for sharp corners on buttons, avatars, and badges.

## Get Ready

Once you have customized your Pillar UI theme and set the desired variables, you are ready to import the necessary components, icons, utilities, or hooks and start developing your application.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@pillar-ui/core'
```

Similarly, you can import icons, utilities, or hooks based on your requirements. Here are some examples:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { Button, Paper, Flex, InputPassword, FormController, Input } from '@pillar-ui/core'
import { Envelop } from '@pillar-ui/icons'
import { toCapitalize } from '@pillar-ui/utilities'
import { useDarkMode } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'

interface FormValues {
  email: string
  password: string
}

function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormValues>({
    email: '',
    password: '',
  })
  const [error, setError] = useState({})

  function handleChange(event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    const { name, value } = event.target
    const newValue = name === 'email' ? toCapitalize(value) : value
    setFormData((prevFormValues) => ({ ...prevFormValues, [name]: newValue }))
  }

  function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {
    e.preventDefault()

    const form = e.target as HTMLFormElement

    if (form.checkValidity()) {
      setErrors({})
    } else {
      const validationErrors: { [key: string]: string } = {}

      for (let i = 0; i < form.elements.length; i++) {
        const field = form.elements[i] as HTMLInputElement
        if (!field.checkValidity()) {
          validationErrors[field.name] = field.validationMessage
        }
      }

      setErrors(validationErrors)
    }
  }

  return (
    <Paper as={Flex} width="100vw" height="100vh" justify="center" items="center" p="sm">
      <Paper as="form" onSubmit={handleSubmit} width="min(320px , 60vw)" borderColor="opacity-6" p="sm">
        <FormController required label="Email">
          <Input
            value={formData.email}
            name="email"
            onChange={handleChange}
            placeholder="Default Input"
            suffix={<Envelop />}
          />
        </FormController>
        <FormController required minLength={7} label="Email" hint="Enter your password (at least 7 characters)">
          <InputPassword value={formData.password} name="password" onChange={handleChange} />
        </FormController>
        <Button> Login </Button>
      </Paper>
    </Paper>
  )
}

export default App
```
