# Getting Started with Pillar UI

Welcome to Pillar UI! This powerful library offers a wide range of reusable UI components, React hooks, icons, and tools to streamline your web development process. Pillar UI focuses on accessibility, scalability, and best practices, helping you build robust and high-quality web applications with ease.

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

    Install Pillar UI in your project:

    ```bash
    npm install @pillar-ui/core
    ```

    For additional features, install these packages:

    ```bash
    npm install @pillar-ui/hooks @pillar-ui/utils @pillar-ui/icons
    ```
        </div>

  </TimelineItem>
   <TimelineItem content='2'>
    <div className="Sf-4">
### Adding Styles

    Import the Pillar UI CSS file in your main app file:

    ```tsx
    import '@pillar-ui/core/main.css'
    ```
        </div>

  </TimelineItem>
     <TimelineItem content='3'>
    <div className="Sf-4">
### Customizing Your Theme

    In Pillar, we offer a comprehensive color palette consisting of 7 default colors, each with 12 variants and support for light and dark modes: `p`(Primary), `se`(Secondary), `su`(Success), `d`(Danger), `w`(Warning), `i`(Info), Background (`b`).

     This robust system allows for extensive customization via a `theme.css` file, where you can not only modify these colors but also adjust other design elements such as spacing, shadows,font-size, radius.

    we strongly advise prioritizing color adjustments for the primary and secondary colors. The remaining colors are often intrinsically linked to specific states or meanings within the system, and altering them could inadvertently impact user comprehension and overall experience.

    By adhering to this guideline, you can ensure a cohesive and intuitive user interface while still enjoying the flexibility to express your brand identity through thoughtful color choices.

    ```css
    :root {
      --Pl-1: hsl(225deg 60% 99.4%);
      --Pl-2: hsl(223deg 100% 98.6%);
      /* ... */
      --Pl-11: hsl(226deg 55% 45%);
      --Pl-12: hsl(226dg 62% 17%);

      /* dark colors */
      --Pd-1: hsl(229deg 24% 10%);
      --Pd-2: hsl(230deg 36.4% 12.9%);
      /* ... */
      --Pd-11: hsl(228deg 100% 75.9%);
      --Pd-12: hsl(226deg 8% 96.3%);
    } /* Add dark mode custom properties here */
    ```

    Import your theme file after the main Pillar UI CSS:

    ```tsx
    import '@pillar-ui/core/main.css'
    import './theme.css'
    ```
        </div>

  </TimelineItem>

    <TimelineItem content="4">
    <div className="Sf-4">

### Using Pillar UI Components

    Now you're ready to use Pillar UI in your project:

    ```tsx
    import { Button, Paper, Input } from '@pillar-ui/core'
    import { Envelope } from '@pillar-ui/icons'

    function App() {
      return (
        <Paper>
          <Input placeholder="Enter email" suffix={<Envelope />} />
          <Button>Submit</Button>
        </Paper>
      )
    }
    ```

        </div>

  </TimelineItem>
      <TimelineItem content="5">
    <div className="Sf-4">
### Developer experience

      Pillar UI enhances your development experience (DX) with simple workflows for component implementation and customization. It eliminates repetitive styling code and offers customization options to fit your project requirements.

      - Responsive Variables: Control component appearance easily with responsive variables.
      - Preventing Repetition: Avoid repetitive styling by using predefined styles and variables.
      - Customization and Extensibility: Customize Pillar UI to match your project's design language and branding.

      ```css
      /*
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        Theme Section
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
      */

      /*  Define custom theme styles here  */

      /*
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        Default Properties Section
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
      */

      :root {
        --button-rad: 0;
        --avatar-rad: 0;
        --badge-rad: 0;
      }
      ```

      Set `--button-rad`, `--avatar-rad`, and `--badge-rad` to 0 for sharp corners on buttons, avatars, and badges.
