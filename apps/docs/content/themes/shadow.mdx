# CSS Shadow Variables

The following CSS variables define shadow styles for different components. These variables allow you to customize shadow properties such as size, spread, and color. The default values employ the `var()` function to provide a flexible and customizable shadow experience.

## Default Shadow Variables

The default shadow variables, defined within the `:root` CSS selector, provide a balanced and responsive shadow experience. Each variable corresponds to a different level of shadow intensity.

## Customizing Shadow Styles

To customize the shadow styles, you can override the default values of the shadow variables by assigning new values to the corresponding --custom-\* variables. Here's an example:

```css showLineNumbers title="themes.css"
:root {
  /* Customize the shadow styles by assigning new values to the --custom-* variables. */
  --shadow-md-custom: 0 10px 20px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Customize the shadow for the md breakpoint */
  --shadow-lg-custom: 0 12px 24px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* Customize the shadow for the lg breakpoint */
}
```

By updating these shadow variables, you can achieve a distinctive shadow style and influence the way components are rendered on the screen.

## Best Practices

- **Maintain consistency:** While you have the freedom to customize shadow styles, we recommend sticking with the provided shadow variables as much as possible. This ensures a consistent and visually harmonious design across different components.
- **Test for clarity:** When customizing shadow intensity, ensure that the shadows do not compromise the clarity and readability of the content. Shadows that are too intense might negatively impact the user experience.

## Conclusion

The CSS shadow variables provide you with the flexibility to create unique and visually appealing shadow styles for your components. By customizing the shadow variables, you can achieve a distinctive design while adhering to design consistency and best practices. Experiment with different shadow values and breakpoints to find the optimal shadow styles that enhance the user interface.

As you make changes to shadow styles, remember to test and preview them across various components and screen sizes to ensure they align with your design goals. Strive for a balance between aesthetics and usability, ensuring that the shadow styles enhance the overall visual experience.
