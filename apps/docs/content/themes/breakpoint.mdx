## Responsive Breakpoints

Our design system follows a **mobile-first approach**, meaning that styles are optimized for smaller screens by default. As the screen size increases, additional styles are applied to enhance the design for larger devices. This is achieved using **media queries with `min-width`**, ensuring that styles apply **from the specified width and up**.

Hereâ€™s a table to explain the breakpoints used in our system:

| **Breakpoint Name** | **`min-width` Value** | **Description**                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **default**         | `0px`                 | Applies to all devices, starting from `0px`.  |
| **xs**              | `480px`               | Styles apply to screens **480px and wider**.  |
| **sm**              | `568px`               | Styles apply to screens **568px and wider**.  |
| **md**              | `768px`               | Styles apply to screens **768px and wider**.  |
| **lg**              | `1024px`              | Styles apply to screens **1024px and wider**. |
| **xl**              | `1360px`              | Styles apply to screens **1360px and wider**. |
| **xxl**             | `1440px`              | Styles apply to screens **1440px and wider**. |

## How Pillar UI Makes Breakpoints Effortless

1. **Grid Component**: Support breakpoints to ensure layouts adapt seamlessly to any screen size.
1. **Fluid Style**: Dynamically adjusts font sizes and spacing based on the viewport, ensuring readability and balance across all devices.
