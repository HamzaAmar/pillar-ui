## Responsive Breakpoints: Making Your Designs Adapt to Any Screen

Responsive breakpoints are screen width ranges where your website adjusts its layout to look great on various devices. They’re essential for creating user-friendly designs that work well on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

### Mobile-First Design System

Our design system follows a **mobile-first approach**, meaning that styles are optimized for smaller screens by default. As the screen size increases, additional styles are applied to enhance the design for larger devices. This is achieved using **media queries with `min-width`**, ensuring that styles apply **from the specified width and up**.

Here’s a table to explain the breakpoints used in our system:

| **Breakpoint Name** | **`min-width` Value** | **Description**                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **default**         | `0px`                 | Applies to all devices, starting from `0px`.  |
| **xs**              | `480px`               | Styles apply to screens **480px and wider**.  |
| **sm**              | `568px`               | Styles apply to screens **568px and wider**.  |
| **md**              | `768px`               | Styles apply to screens **768px and wider**.  |
| **lg**              | `1024px`              | Styles apply to screens **1024px and wider**. |
| **xl**              | `1360px`              | Styles apply to screens **1360px and wider**. |
| **xxl**             | `1440px`              | Styles apply to screens **1440px and wider**. |

## How Pillar UI Makes Breakpoints Effortless

The **Pillar UI Grid Component** handles breakpoints for you. It ensures layouts adapt to any screen size no need to write media queries yourself.

In addition, **fluid typography** and **fluid spacing** automatically adjust font sizes and spacing based on the viewport, ensuring readability and balance across all devices.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Mobile-First**: Design for small screens first, then enhance for larger screens.
2. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on essential breakpoints don’t overcomplicate.
3. **Test Responsively**: Check your design on real devices and browser tools.
4. **Adapt Content**: Adjust font sizes and layout for readability and usability.
