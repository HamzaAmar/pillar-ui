# Theming and Customization with pillar-ui Library

Welcome to the exploration of theming and customization with the **pillar-ui** library. In this guide, you'll learn how to leverage the customization capabilities offered by Pillar UI to create visually appealing user interfaces that align with your project's requirements and brand identity. With a focus on personalization, you'll discover how to modify colors, typography, spacing, and more.

## Customizing the Theming

Pillar UI enables you to tailor the appearance of your user interface to your preferences through theming. By modifying predefined custom properties, you can control various design aspects across your application.

### Changing the Primary Color

To change the primary color of your UI, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `theme.css` in your project's directory.

2. Inside `theme.css`, define the desired primary color using the `--primary-color` custom property. For instance:

   ```css title="theme.css"
   :root {
     --primary-light-1: hsl(225deg 60% 99.4%);
     --primary-light-2: hsl(223deg 100% 98.6%);
     /* from 1 to 12 */
     --primary-light-11: hsl(226deg 55% 45%);
     --primary-light-12: hsl(226dg 62% 17%);

     /*  Dark Mode Section */
     --primary-dark-1: hsl(225deg 60% 99.4%);
     --primary-dark-2: hsl(223deg 100% 98.6%);
     /* from 1 to 12 */
     --primary-dark-11: hsl(226deg 55% 45%);
     --primary-dark-12: hsl(226dg 62% 17%);
   }
   ```

3. Save the `theme.css` file.

4. Import the `theme.css` file in your project, making sure to import it after the `@pillar-ui/core/style` import. For example:

```tsx title='_App.tsx'
import '@pillar-ui/core/style'
import './theme.css'
```

Feel free to experiment with these customizations using similar custom properties and integrate them into your project's theme.css file to create a UI that matches your design style.

### Exploring Additional Customizations

Beyond changing the primary color, you can further customize your UI by adjusting:

- Typography: Modify font sizes, families, and weights to suit your project's visual style.
- Spacing: Control padding and margins for consistent layout and spacing.
- Shadows: Add or modify shadows to enhance the visual depth of UI elements.

Feel free to experiment with these customizations using similar custom properties and integrate them into your project's `theme.css` file.

### Default UI Style

In some cases, you may want to set default styles for components to ensure consistency throughout your application. For example, if you wish to change the default value of the border-radius for buttons, you can use the --button-corner custom property. To make all buttons have full circular corners, you can set it to 100px:

```css
:root {
  --button-corner: 100px;
  --avatar-corner: 0;
  --badge-corner: 0;
}
```

By setting `--button-corner` to `100px`, all buttons will automatically have full circular corners without needing to repeat the corner="full" prop for each button individually.

When working with Pillar UI components, you can easily find the default values of their props in the component documentation. At the end of each component's documentation page, you'll find a section that lists the default values for the component's props. This makes it convenient to understand the initial state of each prop and how it affects the component's appearance and behavior.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've delved into the world of theming and customization with the **pillar-ui** library. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you've acquired the skills to personalize your UI's appearance to align with your design language and brand identity. With Pillar UI's customization capabilities, you have the flexibility to create visually engaging and unique user interfaces that stand out.

Keep exploring and experimenting with different customizations to create a cohesive and delightful user experience across your application.
