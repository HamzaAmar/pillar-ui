# Setting Up the Project

In this section, we will guide you through setting up a new Create React App (CRA) project to build your e-commerce website using the `pillar-ui` library. By the end of this section, you'll have a project environment ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with this guide, ensure you have the following:

1. **Node.js and npm:** You need Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). The npm package manager comes bundled with Node.js.

2. **Basic knowledge of React:** This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of React concepts, such as JSX, components, props, and state. If you're new to React, you might find the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) helpful.

3. **A text editor:** You'll need a text editor to write and edit your code. Some popular text editors include [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

4. **A web browser:** You'll need a web browser to view your React application. This guide assumes you're using a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

Once you've ensured that you have all the prerequisites, you can proceed with the rest of the guide.

## Step 1: Create a New CRA Project

If you don't have `create-react-app` installed, you can install it globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Now, create a new CRA project by running:

```bash
npx create-react-app pillar-ecommerce
```

Replace `pillar-ecommerce` with your desired project name.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd pillar-ecommerce
```

## Step 3: Install the pillar-ui Library

The `pillar-ui` library consists of several packages, each serving a specific purpose to enhance your web development process. These packages include:

- `@pillar-ui/core`: This package provides a collection of reusable UI components designed for modern web development, adhering to best practices and offering a highly customizable experience.

- `@pillar-ui/utils`: Here, you'll find utility functions and tools that assist with common tasks, streamlining your development workflow and increasing efficiency.

- `@pillar-ui/icons`: Need a variety of icons for your project? This package offers a library of scalable icons suitable for different use cases, all designed to seamlessly integrate into modern user interfaces.

- `@pillar-ui/hooks`: This package offers a set of React hooks that you can easily incorporate into your applications to enhance functionality and interactivity.

For the purposes of this tutorial, you'll need to install all of these packages to access the full range of `pillar-ui` functionalities. To do this, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm install @pillar-ui/core @pillar-ui/utils @pillar-ui/icons @pillar-ui/hooks
```

With the packages installed, you're ready to start incorporating the powerful features of the `pillar-ui` library into your project. Continue with the upcoming sections to learn how to create core components and add advanced features to your e-commerce website.

## Step 4: Project Structure

Your project's directory structure should look like this:

```plaintext
pillar-ecommerce/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...
```

## Adding Styles

To enhance the appearance and maintain visual consistency of your Vite React app using Pillar components, follow these steps to add the necessary styles. Pillar provides a CSS file that not only enhances the styling but also introduces additional features such as dark mode support and right-to-left (RTL) language support.

- Open the root file of your Vite React app project.

- Locate the file where your app is initialized, typically named App.(ts, tsx, js,jsx).

- Import the Pillar CSS file by adding the following import statement at the top of the file:

```tsx
import '@pillar-ui/core/style'
```

## Step 6: Start the Development Server

Now, start the development server and see your CRA app in action:

```bash
npm start
```

Your CRA app will open in your default web browser. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

With your project environment set up, you're ready to start building your e-commerce website using the `pillar-ui` library. In the upcoming sections, we'll guide you through creating the core components of the website.
