## Default Colors

The Pillar UI color theme provides a set of default colors that are commonly used throughout the framework. These default colors are defined by their respective variables and can be easily applied to different elements of your user interface.

### Primary Colors

The primary colors `indigo` in the Pillar UI color theme are defined using the --primary-\* variables. These colors are typically used for highlighting important elements or creating a sense of prominence. The primary colors range from light to dark, with --primary-1 being the lightest and --primary-12 being the darkest.

### Secondary Colors

The secondary colors `pink` are defined using the --secondary-\* variables. These colors are complementary to the primary colors and can be used to provide visual variation or indicate secondary information. Similar to primary colors, the secondary colors range from light to dark, with --secondary-1 being the lightest and --secondary-12 being the darkest.

### Danger Colors

The danger colors `red` are defined using the --danger-\* variables. These colors are typically used to indicate critical or error-related elements in your UI. The danger colors range from light to dark, with --danger-1 being the lightest and --danger-12 being the darkest.

### Warning Colors

The warning colors `orange` are defined using the --warning-\* variables. These colors are used to convey cautionary information or warnings to users. The warning colors range from light to dark, with --warning-1 being the lightest and --warning-12 being the darkest.

### Success Colors

The success colors `green` are defined using the --success-\* variables. These colors are used to represent successful or positive elements in your UI, such as completed tasks or successful operations. The success colors range from light to dark, with --success-1 being the lightest and --success-12 being the darkest.

### Opacity Colors

The opacity colors `white opacity in light dark opacity in dark` are defined using the --opacity-\* variables. These colors are used to provide varying levels of transparency or opacity to elements in your UI. The opacity colors range from light to dark, with --opacity-1 being the lightest and --opacity-12 being the darkest.

### Surface Colors

The surface colors `white in light mode and dark in dark mode` are defined using the --surface-\* variables. These colors are used as background colors for surfaces or containers in your UI. The surface colors range from light to dark, with --surface-1 being the lightest and --surface-12 being the darkest.

### Dark Mode

Pillar UI also provides a dark mode color scheme. In the dark mode, the colors have a different set of variables prefixed with --dark. These variables allow you to define specific colors for the dark mode, ensuring a consistent appearance across light and dark themes.

By leveraging the predefined color variables in the Pillar UI color theme, you can easily create visually cohesive and harmonious user interfaces while maintaining flexibility and customization options.
