## Props

### Size

- Type: string
- Default: `md`
- Options: `2xs` `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `2xl`

The size prop controls the size of the text. The following values are valid:

<Playground direction="column" name="linkSize" root="link" />

### Weight

The weight prop controls the weight (boldness) of the text. The following values are valid:

<Playground direction="column" name="linkWeight" root="link" />

### Truncate

The truncate prop with the value of "multiline" will truncate the text if it exceeds the specified numberLine prop value and will display an ellipsis at the end of the last visible line. On the other hand, if the truncate prop value is "singleline", it will truncate the text to fit within a single line and display an ellipsis at the end of the truncated text.

truncate (optional): Determines whether the text should be truncated and how it should be truncated. If the value is "singleline", the text will be truncated to fit within a single line and display an ellipsis at the end of the truncated text. If the value is "multiline", the text will be truncated if it exceeds the specified numberLine prop value and display an ellipsis at the end of the last visible line.

<Playground name="linkTruncate" root="link" />

### Align

This property specifies the horizontal alignment of the text within the parent element. It can take one of the following values:

<Playground direction="column" name="linkAlign" root="link" />

### Color

The color prop sets the color of the text .The contrast prop adjusts the contrast between link text and its background. The default ensures high contrast for optimal readability. Using the low prop reduces contrast, which can impact accessibility for some users.

<Playground direction="column" name="linkColor" root="link" />

### Leading

you can customize the leading (line height) of your text by using the leading prop. This prop accepts four different values: "normal", "sm", "md", and "lg"

Example

<Playground direction="column" name="linkLeading" root="link" />

By using the leading prop, you can easily adjust the line height of your text to create a more visually appealing design.

### dir RTL language

This prop sets the direction of the text within the component. It accepts the values "rtl" for right-to-left direction or "ltr" for left-to-right direction. This prop is useful when displaying text in languages that are read from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew.

<Playground direction="column" name="linkRTL" root="link" />

## Use Case

The Link component can be used to display text in various sizes and weights.

## Troubleshooting

If the text is not displaying as expected, make sure that the correct props are being used and that any necessary styles are applied.

## Conclusion

The Link component is a versatile component that can be used to display text in various sizes and weights with full accessibility and TypeScript support.
