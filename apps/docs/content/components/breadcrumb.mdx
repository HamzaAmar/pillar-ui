## Props

## Separator

The separator prop allows you to customize the separator between each BreadcrumbItem. You can pass a string, a React element, or a component to use as the separator.

<Playground direction="column" name="breadcrumbSeparator" root="breadcrumb" />

In the example above, we pass a string (- and \*) as the separator in the first two examples, and a custom React component (Minus) as the separator in the third example. Note that the separator is only displayed between BreadcrumbItems, and not before the first or after the last item.

## Color

You can customize the color of the breadcrumb by passing a color prop to the Breadcrumb component. The available colors are "red", "orange", "green", "secondary", "purple", "brown", "primary", and "bg". Here are some examples:

<Playground direction="column" name="breadcrumbColor" root="breadcrumb" />

## Breadcrumb Icons

You can add icons to your breadcrumb by passing an `icon` prop to the `Breadcrumb.Item` component. The icon can be any valid React element. Here are some examples:

<Playground direction="column" name="breadcrumbIcon" root="breadcrumb" />

This section demonstrates the use of icons for each Breadcrumb.Item in the Breadcrumb component. The icons are passed as children to each Breadcrumb.Item, and are displayed alongside the item text. The width prop is used to set the size of the icons.

## Sizes

The Breadcrumb component supports the following sizes:

You can set the size by passing the size prop to the Breadcrumb component with one of the above values. Here's an example of using the different sizes:

<Playground direction="column" name="breadcrumbSize" root="breadcrumb" />

## Troubleshooting

Accordion items are not expanding or collapsing
If the accordion items are not expanding or collapsing as expected, ensure that the header prop of each AccordionItem component is a unique string or number. If multiple items have the same header value, only one of them will be toggled when clicked.

## Conclusion

The Accordion component is a versatile and accessible way to display collapsible content sections in your React applications. It offers a variety of customization options and is fully compatible with TypeScript
