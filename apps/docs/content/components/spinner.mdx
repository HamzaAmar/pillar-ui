## Props

The Spinner component accepts the following props:

### Color

- Type: string

- Options: `danger` | `warning` | `success` | `primary` | `secondary` | `bg`

The color prop sets the color of the spinner. You can choose from a range of colors including green, red, orange, primary, purple, secondary, brown and bg.

<SpinnerColors />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Spinner.tsx"
import { Spinner, Flex } from '@pillar-ui/core'

export function SpinnerColors() {
  return (
    <Flex gap="sm">
      <Spinner color="suc" />
      <Spinner color="dan" />
      <Spinner color="war" />
      <Spinner color="pri" />
      <Spinner color="sec" />
      <Spinner color="bg" />
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

### Size

- Type: string
- Default: `md`
- Options: `2xs` | `xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `xl` | `2xl`

The size prop sets the size of the spinner. You can choose from a range of sizes including 3xs, 2xs, xs, sm, md, xl, 2xl and 3xl.

<SpinnerSizes />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Spinner.tsx"
import { Spinner, Flex } from '@pillar-ui/core'

export function SpinnerSizes() {
  return (
    <Flex gap="sm" items="center">
      <Spinner size="3xs" />
      <Spinner size="2xs" />
      <Spinner size="xs" />
      <Spinner size="sm" />
      <Spinner size="md" />
      <Spinner size="xl" />
      <Spinner size="2xl" />
      <Spinner size="3xl" />
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

### Thickness

The thickness prop sets the thickness of the spinner. You can set any thickness value in pixels.

<SpinnerThickness />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Spinner.tsx"
import { Spinner, Flex } from '@pillar-ui/core'

export function SpinnerThickness() {
  return (
    <Flex gap="sm" items="center">
      <Spinner thickness="1px" />
      <Spinner thickness="2px" />
      <Spinner thickness="3px" />
      <Spinner thickness="4px" />
      <Spinner thickness="5px" />
      <Spinner thickness="6px" />
      <Spinner thickness="200px" />
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

### Invert

The invert prop inverts the color of the spinner, which can be useful when the spinner's default color clashes with the background color.

<SpinnerInvert />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Spinner.tsx"
import { Spinner, Flex } from '@pillar-ui/core'

export function SpinnerInvert() {
  return (
    <div className="l_flow__md">
      <Flex gap="sm" items="center">
        <Spinner color="suc" />
        <Spinner color="dan" />
        <Spinner color="war" />
        <Spinner color="pri" />
        <Spinner color="purple" />
        <Spinner color="sec" />
        <Spinner color="brown" />
        <Spinner color="bg" />
      </Flex>
      <Flex gap="sm" items="center">
        <Spinner invert color="suc" />
        <Spinner invert color="dan" />
        <Spinner invert color="war" />
        <Spinner invert color="pri" />
        <Spinner invert color="purple" />
        <Spinner invert color="sec" />

      </Flex>
    </div>
  )
}
```
