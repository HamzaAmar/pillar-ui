## Fallback

The `fallback` prop is used to display a fallback if the main image cannot be loaded or encountered an error.

- The image file is not found. Make sure the image file is in the same directory as the HTML file, or that you have provided the correct path to the image file.
- The image file is corrupt. Try downloading the image file again.
- The image file is too large. Some web servers have a maximum file size limit for images. If your image file is too large, try resizing it or using a different image file format.
- The image file is not a supported format. Some web servers only support certain image file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF. If your image file is not in one of these formats, try converting it to a supported format.
- The image file is blocked by the browser's security settings. Some browsers block images from certain websites. If you are seeing a message that says "Image is blocked," try clearing your browser's cache and cookies.

## Avatar Group

## limit

<Playground direction="column" name="avatarGroupLimit" root="avatar" />

## layoutstack' 'grid'

<Playground direction="column" name="avatarGroupStack" root="avatar" />

## Context Props

The Avatar.Group component can be used to group multiple Avatar components together, and set common props such as color, corner, size, and variant for all the avatars in the group, instead of repeating them for each individual Avatar. This can help reduce repetition in your code and make it more efficient.
