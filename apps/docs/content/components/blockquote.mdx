## Props

The Blockquote component is a versatile co
mponent used to display quoted text with an optional citation. It allows you to customize various aspects of the blockquote, including color, size, corner style, and more.

### Corner

Type: string
Default: `md`
Options: `sharp` | `xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `circle` | `full`
The size prop determines the corners of the Blockquote. It accepts any of the Size types defined in our library see options above. If not provided, it defaults to the md size.

The corner prop determines the border radius of the Blockquote. It accepts any of the Corner types defined in your library, including (sharp, xs, sm, md, xl, full, circle), and pill. If not provided, it defaults to the square corner.

Example usage:

<BlockquotePlayGround.Corners />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Accordion.tsx"
function CornerCorners() {
  return (
    <div className="l_flow__md">
      <Blockquote corner="sharp" cite="John Doe">
        This is the quoted text.
      </Blockquote>
      <Blockquote corner="xs" cite="John Doe">
        This is the quoted text.
      </Blockquote>
      <Blockquote corner="sm" cite="John Doe">
