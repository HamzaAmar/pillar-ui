## Use Case

The AccordionBase component is useful when you need to display a list of items with associated content that can be collapsed and expanded. This can be useful in a variety of contexts such as:

- FAQ pages
- Product pages with detailed descriptions
- Tutorials with multiple steps

## Implementation Details

To implement an accordion, you will need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure should consist of a container element with multiple child elements, each representing a section of content. Each section should have a header element that the user can click to expand or collapse the content within that section. You can use CSS to style the accordion and JavaScript to handle the click events and toggle the visibility of the content.

## Accessibility

When implementing an accordion, it's important to consider accessibility for users with disabilities. Some users may have difficulty using a mouse or touch screen, so it's important to ensure that the accordion can be navigated using the keyboard. Additionally, screen readers may have difficulty with dynamically hidden content, so it's important to provide appropriate ARIA attributes to make the accordion accessible to all users.

## TypeScript Support

If you're using TypeScript in your project, you can define interfaces for the data used by the accordion and ensure that the correct types are passed to the component props.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the accordion not functioning as expected, make sure that the HTML structure and CSS classes are correct, and that the JavaScript
