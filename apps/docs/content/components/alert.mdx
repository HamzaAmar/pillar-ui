The as prop allows you to customize the tag of the alert. The default tag is div, but you can use the as prop to change it to any other valid HTML tag, such as span or article.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Alert.tsx"
<Alert as='span' color="danger" title="hello"  />
<Alert as='article' color="danger" title="hello"  />
```

## Custom the style

We know that you may not always like the style of the alerts that we provide in our library. That's why we've given you the ability to customize the style of the alerts to your liking. You can use the style prop to set the background color, font, and other properties of the alert, and you can use the className prop to add custom CSS classes to the alert.

<AlertPlayGround.CustomStyle />

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Alert.tsx"
<Alert color="danger" title="hello" className="u_secondary" />
<Alert color="danger" title="hello" style={{ background: 'success' }} />
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a core feature of Pillar UI, extending to components like the Alert. Here's a guide on ensuring accessibility when employing the Alert component:

- **Clarity in Language:** Opt for straightforward wording in the Alert's title and message, sidestepping jargon or multi-meaning terms that could confuse users.
- **Contrast Considerations:** Guarantee that the Alert's color sharply contrasts the background, ensuring readability for those with color vision impairments or limited sight.
- **ARIA Roles and Attributes:** Leverage ARIA roles and attributes for accurate interpretation by assistive tech. For example, role="alert" signifies crucial user information.
- **Support for Reduced Motion and Forced Colors:** Our components also accommodate users with "Reduced Motion" preferences, ensuring a comfortable experience. Additionally, we ensure that our components remain readable and usable for users relying on the "Forced Colors" feature.

## Best Practice

- Use Alerts to provide feedback to the user when an action is successful or fails.
- Use Alerts to inform users of important or time-sensitive information, such as system outages, maintenance, or changes in a workflow.
- Use Alerts to communicate errors and warnings to the user, such as invalid input or unsuccessful form submissions.
- Use Alerts sparingly and avoid overusing them, as they can be distracting and overwhelm the user.
- Avoid using technical jargon or ambiguous language

## Use case:

The Alert component can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

- Displaying error messages or warnings
- Providing feedback to the user after completing an action
- Notifying the user of important information or updates
- Asking for confirmation before performing a critical action

## Troubleshooting:

If the Alert component is not behaving as expected, it may be due to an incorrect usage of the component or the props passed to it. Some common issues to check for include:

- Incorrectly passing props to the Alert component
- Using an invalid value for a prop, such as an invalid alert type
- Improperly handling the onClose function or passing in an incorrect function
- Missing required props for the Alert component
- If you are still having issues, try checking the documentation or seeking help from the community or the @pillar-ui/core library maintainers.

## Conclusion:

The Alert component is a powerful tool for displaying messages to the user in a clear and effective way. By customizing its appearance and behavior using props, the Alert component can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an application.

We hope this documentation helps you understand and use the Alert component in your projects! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
