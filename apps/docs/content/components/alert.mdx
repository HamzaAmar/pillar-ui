### Isomerphic Alert

The as prop allows you to customize the tag of the alert. The default tag is div, but you can use the as prop to change it to any other valid HTML tag, such as span or article.

Here is an example of how to display the alert as a span:

```tsx
<Alert as='span' color="danger" title="hello" style={{ background: 'success' }} />
<Alert as='article' color="danger" title="hello" style={{ background: 'success' }} />
```

## custom the style

We know that you may not always like the style of the alerts that we provide in our library. That's why we've given you the ability to customize the style of the alerts to your liking. You can use the style prop to set the background color, font, and other properties of the alert, and you can use the className prop to add custom CSS classes to the alert.

Here is an example of how to use the `style` prop to set the background color of the alert:

```tsx
<Alert color="danger" title="hello" style={{ background: 'success' }} />
```

Here is an example of how to use the `className` prop to add custom CSS classes to the alert:

```tsx
<Alert color="danger" title="hello" className="u_secondary" />
```

## accessibility

Accessibility is an important consideration for any web component, including the Alert component. Here are some accessibility best practices to follow when using the Alert component:

- Use clear and concise language in the title and message of the Alert. Avoid using jargon, technical terms, or words with multiple meanings that could cause confusion.
- Ensure that the color of the Alert provides sufficient contrast with the background color to ensure that it is readable for people with color vision deficiencies or low vision.
- Provide a text alternative for any icons used in the Alert component for users who rely on screen readers or have other disabilities.
- If the Alert component is closable, ensure that it can be closed using the keyboard as well as the mouse or touch screen. For example, users should be able to close the Alert using the Escape key.
- Use ARIA roles and attributes to help assistive technologies interpret the Alert component correctly. For example, the role="alert" attribute can be used to indicate that the component contains important information that the user should be aware of.

By following these accessibility best practices, you can ensure that the Alert component is usable and accessible for all users, including those with disabilities or impairments.

## Best Practice

- Use Alerts to provide feedback to the user when an action is successful or fails.
- Use Alerts to inform users of important or time-sensitive information, such as system outages, maintenance, or changes in a workflow.
- Use Alerts to communicate errors and warnings to the user, such as invalid input or unsuccessful form submissions.
- Use Alerts sparingly and avoid overusing them, as they can be distracting and overwhelm the user.
- Avoid using technical jargon or ambiguous language

## Use case:

The Alert component can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

- Displaying error messages or warnings
- Providing feedback to the user after completing an action
- Notifying the user of important information or updates
- Asking for confirmation before performing a critical action

## Implementation details:

The Alert component in this documentation is an example of a React functional component. It can be imported from the @pillar/core library and used in a JSX file.

The Alert component takes in several optional props that can be used to customize its appearance and behavior, such as type, message, dismissible, onClose, and more. It also includes default styles for different types of alerts, such as success, warning, and error.

## TypeScript support:

The Alert component includes TypeScript support for type checking and better code editor tooling. TypeScript definitions are included in the @pillar/core library, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications with the Alert component.

## Troubleshooting:

If the Alert component is not behaving as expected, it may be due to an incorrect usage of the component or the props passed to it. Some common issues to check for include:

- Incorrectly passing props to the Alert component
- Using an invalid value for a prop, such as an invalid alert type
- Improperly handling the onClose function or passing in an incorrect function
- Missing required props for the Alert component
- If you are still having issues, try checking the documentation or seeking help from the community or the @pillar/core library maintainers.

## Conclusion:

The Alert component is a powerful tool for displaying messages to the user in a clear and effective way. By customizing its appearance and behavior using props, the Alert component can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an application.

We hope this documentation helps you understand and use the Alert component in your projects! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
