### Content

The Content is not a props but we use it here to describe all the props related to the content of the alert.

- **title**: The title of the alert.
- **description**: The description of the alert.
- **icon**: The icon of the alert.

<Playground direction="column" name="alertContent" root="alert" />

### Icon

<Playground direction="column" name="alertIcon" root="alert" />

### Closable

The `closable` prop controls whether the alert can be closed by the user. When set to `true`, a close button appears on the alert, allowing users to dismiss it. If not specified, it defaults to `false`.

<Playground direction="column" name="alertClosable" root="alert" />

### Inline

<Playground direction="column" name="alertInline" root="alert" />

## Best Practice

- Use Alerts to provide feedback to the user when an action is successful or fails.
- Use Alerts to inform users of important or time-sensitive information, such as system outages, maintenance, or changes in a workflow.
- Use Alerts to communicate errors and warnings to the user, such as invalid input or unsuccessful form submissions.
- Use Alerts sparingly and avoid overusing them, as they can be distracting and overwhelm the user.
- Avoid using technical jargon or ambiguous language

## Conclusion:

The Alert component is a powerful tool for displaying messages to the user in a clear and effective way. By customizing its appearance and behavior using props, the Alert component can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an application.
