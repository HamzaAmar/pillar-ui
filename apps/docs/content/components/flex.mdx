## Usage

### Gap

This property provides you with the ability to manage and adjust the amount of space between the individual child elements within a Flex container. It allows you to fine-tune the spacing, ensuring optimal alignment and visual harmony between the flex items.

<Playground name="flexGap" root="flex" />

### Wrap

This option lets you decide if items inside a container should wrap to the next line when there's insufficient horizontal space to show them in a single row. This maintains content organization and readability, crucial for smaller screens or varying device sizes.

<Playground name="flexWrap" root="flex" />

### Direction

This attribute defines the orientation in which the flexible items within a Flex container are laid out. It determines whether these items are arranged horizontally or vertically, influencing the overall flow and structure of the container's content.

<Playground name="flexDirection" root="flex" />

### Justify

This property governs the positioning of child elements within a container along the horizontal axis. It enables you to control how the child items are aligned in relation to each other, influencing their placement in terms of left-to-right or right-to-left arrangement.

<Playground name="flexJustify" root="flex" />

### Items

This property allows you to determine the positioning of child elements along the vertical axis within a container. It provides control over how the child items are aligned with respect to each other, influencing their arrangement from top to bottom or bottom to top.

<Playground name="flexItems" root="flex" />

### Best Practices

- Use the `gap` property to maintain consistent spacing between child elements without adding additional styles.
- Employ the `wrap` property to ensure your layout remains responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes.
- Utilize the `direction` property to manage the orientation of child elements, aiding in creating intuitive and well-structured layouts.
- Leverage the `justify` and `items` properties to easily align content, enhancing the visual appeal and readability of your layouts.

### Conclusion

The Flex component is a versatile tool designed to simplify the creation of well-aligned and responsive layouts. Its wide array of properties allows for detailed customization, ensuring your content is displayed in a polished and organized manner.
