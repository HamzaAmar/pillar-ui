## Usage

## Props

The Paper component accepts the following props:

### Background

### Color

The color prop determines the text color of the Paper component. It accepts any of the Color types defined in our library or (Color-Step) (for 12 different levels of the color). If not provided, it `inherit` the of its parent.

We recommend using the color from step 11 or 12 because it provides high contrast against the background. It's important to always check color contrast when changing the background or paper color.

### Width

The Paper component provides a convenient width prop for controlling its horizontal dimensions. This prop accepts specific string values that correspond to predefined width classes.
**Available Width Classes:**

| Class Name Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `30-char` Sets the width to a minimum of 30 characters or 100%, whichever is smaller. |
| `45-char` Sets the width to a minimum of 45 characters or 100%, whichever is smaller. |
| `60-char` Sets the width to a minimum of 60 characters or 100%, whichever is smaller. |
| `75-char` Sets the width to a minimum of 75 characters or 100%, whichever is smaller. |
| `90-char` Sets the width to a minimum of 90 characters or 100%, whichever is smaller. |
| `half` Sets the width to 50%.                                                         |
| `one-third` Sets the width to 33.3%.                                                  |
| `full` Sets the width to 100%.                                                        |
| `fit-content` Sets the width to the content's intrinsic width.                        |

**How it Works:**

The prop leverage the CSS `min()` function to ensure the `Paper` component never exceeds the available space within its parent container. This makes the component responsive across different screen sizes and viewport widths.

**Choosing the Right Class:**

- **Characters (`ch`):** Ideal for controlling line length and readability of text content.
- **(half, one-threadId,full):** Useful for proportional layouts where the `Paper` component should occupy a relative portion of its parent.
- **`fit-content`:** Lets the content itself determine the width, which is handy for elements with varying content sizes.
