## Props

### Title

<Playground name="separatorTitle" root="separator" />

### Color

<Playground name="separatorColor" root="separator" />

### Thickness

The thickness prop determines the thickness of the separator. It accepts a string representing a length in pixels.

<Playground name="separatorThickness" root="separator" />

### Direction

Specifies the direction of the separator line.
The `direction` prop is used to control the orientation of the separator line. It accepts two possible values: "horizontal" and "vertical".

<Playground name="separatorDirection" root="separator" />

## Use Case

- To visually separate different sections of content. For example, you could use a separator to separate the header of a page from the body of the page, or to separate different paragraphs of text.
- To create a sense of hierarchy or order within a layout. For example, you could use a separator to visually group related elements together, or to create a sense of progression or movement.
- To emphasize important information. For example, you could use a separator to draw attention to a call to action button, or to highlight a key piece of information.
- To create a sense of balance or symmetry within a layout. For example, you could use a separator to balance out two large elements on either side of a page, or to create a sense of visual rhythm.
- To add visual interest or texture to a layout. For example, you could use a separator to create a grid pattern, or to add a touch of color or pattern to a page.

These are just a few examples of how separators can be used in design. With a little creativity, you can find many other ways to use separators to improve the look and feel of your designs.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when implementing the Separator component can include incorrect positioning, incorrect styling, or issues with accessibility. Troubleshooting these issues may involve inspecting the HTML and CSS, checking for errors in the code, and testing with different devices and browsers.
