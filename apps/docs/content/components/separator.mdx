## Props

### title

<SeparatorPlayGround.Title />

```tsx
export const SeparatorTitle = () => {
  return (
    <Paper className="playground" as={Flex} gap="sm" borderColor="opacity-6" p="sm" background="surface-3" corner="sm">
      <Separator title="Login Here" />
      <Separator title="Login Here" position="center" />
      <Separator title="Login Here" position="end" />
    </Paper>
  )
}
```

### color

- Type: string
- Default: `primary`
- Options: `danger` | `warning` | `success` | `primary` | `surface` | `secondary`

The color prop determines the color of the separator. It accepts a string representing a color name or a color value in hex, rgb, rgba format.

<SeparatorPlayGround.Colors />

```tsx showLineNumbers title='_App.tsx'
import { Separator, Paper } from '@pillar-ui/core'

export const SeparatorColors = () => {
  return (
    <Paper className="playground" borderColor="opacity-6" p="sm" flow="sm" background="surface-3" corner="sm">
      <Separator color="success" />
      <Separator color="danger" />
      <Separator color="warning" />
      <Separator color="primary" />
      <Separator color="secondary" />
      <Separator color="surface" />
    </Paper>
  )
}
```

### thickness

The thickness prop determines the thickness of the separator. It accepts a string representing a length in pixels.

<SeparatorPlayGround.Thickness />

```tsx showLineNumbers title='_App.tsx'
export const SeparatorThickness = () => {
  return (
    <Paper
      className="playground"
      as={Flex}
      gap="sm"
      items="center"
      borderColor="opacity-6"
      p="sm"
      flow="sm"
      background="surface-3"
      corner="sm"
    >
      <Separator thickness="3xs" />
      <Separator thickness="2xs" />
      <Separator thickness="xs" />
      <Separator thickness="sm" />
      <Separator thickness="md" />
      <Separator thickness="lg" />
      <Separator thickness="xl" />
      <Separator thickness="2xl" />
      <Separator thickness="3xl" />
    </Paper>
  )
}
```

### direction

- direction (optional)
- Type: string

Specifies the direction of the separator line.
The `direction` prop is used to control the orientation of the separator line. It accepts two possible values: "horizontal" and "vertical".

Example usage:

<SeparatorPlayGround.Direction />

```tsx
import { Paper, Separator } from '@pillar-ui/core'
export const SeparatorDirection = () => {
  return (
    <Paper className="playground" borderColor="opacity-6" p="sm" flow="sm" background="surface-3" corner="sm">
      <Separator direction="horizontal" />
      <Separator direction="vertical" />
    </Paper>
  )
}
```

## Use Case

- To visually separate different sections of content. For example, you could use a separator to separate the header of a page from the body of the page, or to separate different paragraphs of text.
- To create a sense of hierarchy or order within a layout. For example, you could use a separator to visually group related elements together, or to create a sense of progression or movement.
- To emphasize important information. For example, you could use a separator to draw attention to a call to action button, or to highlight a key piece of information.
- To create a sense of balance or symmetry within a layout. For example, you could use a separator to balance out two large elements on either side of a page, or to create a sense of visual rhythm.
- To add visual interest or texture to a layout. For example, you could use a separator to create a grid pattern, or to add a touch of color or pattern to a page.

These are just a few examples of how separators can be used in design. With a little creativity, you can find many other ways to use separators to improve the look and feel of your designs.

## Implementation details

The Separator component typically consists of a single line, either horizontal or vertical. The line can be styled to match the surrounding content, or it can be given a unique style to make it stand out. The Separator component can be implemented using HTML and CSS, or with a UI framework or library such as React, Angular, or Vue.

## Accessibility

When implementing the Separator component, it's important to ensure that it is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This can include using appropriate colors and contrast ratios, and ensuring that the component is keyboard accessible.

## TypeScript Support

Many UI frameworks and libraries, including React, Angular, and Vue, have built-in TypeScript support, which can be useful when implementing the Separator component. Using TypeScript can help catch errors early in the development process and make it easier to maintain and scale the component over time.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when implementing the Separator component can include incorrect positioning, incorrect styling, or issues with accessibility. Troubleshooting these issues may involve inspecting the HTML and CSS, checking for errors in the code, and testing with different devices and browsers.

## Conclusion

The Separator component is a useful UI element for creating visual separation between different sections of content. It can be implemented using HTML and CSS, or with a UI framework or library. When implementing the Separator component, it's important to consider accessibility, TypeScript support, and troubleshooting common issues.
