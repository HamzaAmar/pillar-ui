## Best Practice

- Use clear and concise labels. The label should be descriptive and accurate, and it should clearly indicate what information is being requested to add label to the input Please wrap it within a [FormField Component]().
- Use placeholder text. The placeholder text should provide a hint to the user about what information is expected.
- Use a consistent style for all input fields. This will help to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Choose only one variant and use it consistently throughout your site. Do not mix variants within the same site.
- Validate the input data on both the client and server side. This will help to ensure that the user enters the correct information and provide a good user experience.
- Provide feedback to the user about the validity of their input data. Use FormController to send error messages to the component, which will then display them to the user.
- If your input field needs more information, use the hint prop to provide that information to the user. This will help the user to understand what information is expected and to enter the correct information.
