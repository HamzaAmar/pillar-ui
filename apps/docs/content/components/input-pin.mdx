## Usage

To use the PinInput component, import it from `@pillar-ui/core`. Then, create the PinInput with the desired props:

## Props

The PinInput component supports the following props:

### Filled

A filled input is a type of PinInput field that has a background color. This makes it easy for users to see where they are typing and to distinguish between input fields.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputFilled" root="form/pinInput" />

### Outline

The outline variant of the PinInput component is a type of input field that has a border around it. This makes it easy for users to see where they are typing and to distinguish between input fields.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputOutline" root="form/pinInput" />

### Bordered

The bordered variant of the PinInput component is a type of input field that has a bottom border that visually separates the input from others and shows the edge of the input.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputBordered" root="form/pinInput" />

### Size

The size prop determines the overall size of the PinInput. It accepts any of the Size types defined in our library (2 to 2xl). If not provided, it defaults to the `md` size.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputSize" root="form/pinInput" />

### Corner

The corner prop determines the border radius of the PinInput. It accepts any of the Corner types defined in our library (sharp, 3, sm, md, lg, xl, full, circle). If not provided, it defaults to the `sm` corner.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputCorner" root="form/pinInput" />

### Color

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputColor" root="form/pinInput" />

### Placeholder

The placeholder prop sets the default placeholder character displayed in each input field of the PinInput. It can be any single character or symbol.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputPlaceholder" root="form/pinInput" />

### Length

The length prop specifies the number of input fields in the PinInput. Each input field will hold a single character of the PIN or security code. If not provided, it defaults to `4`.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputLength" root="form/pinInput" />

### Types

The `ColorPinType` component story demonstrates how to use different input types with the PinInput component.

<Playground direction="column" name="pinInputType" root="form/pinInput" />
