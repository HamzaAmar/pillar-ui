## Introduction

The useDebounce custom hook is a React hook that allows you to debounce a value, reducing the number of times a function is called when a value changes rapidly. This hook is useful for scenarios where you want to delay the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed without any further changes to the value.

Debouncing is a technique that helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary computations or API calls when a value is rapidly changing. With the useDebounce hook, you can control the delay period and ensure that the function is only invoked after a specified time has elapsed since the last value change.

## Installation

To use the useDebounce hook in your React project, you can install it from NPM:

```shell
npm { useDebounce } install '@pillar-ui/hooks'
```

## Usage

To use the useDebounce hook, simply import it into your component and call it like any other React hook:

```tsx title='app.ts' showLineNumbers
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import useDebounce from '@pillar-ui/hooks'

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')
  const [debouncedValue] = useDebounce(value, 500)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Perform some action with the debounced value
    // you can do an api call or fetch something
    console.log('Debounced value:', debouncedValue)
  }, [debouncedValue])

  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} placeholder="Type something..." />
}
```

The useDebounce hook takes two arguments: the value you want to debounce and the delay in milliseconds. It returns an array containing the debounced value. You can use the debounced value in your component logic, such as performing API requests or triggering computations.

## Use Cases

- **Autosuggest/Search**: When building an autosuggest or search feature, you can use the useDebounce hook to delay the API call for search results until the user has finished typing. This prevents excessive API requests while the user is still typing and provides a smoother user experience.
- **Form Validation**: When performing form validation that requires API requests or computationally expensive operations, the useDebounce hook can be used to delay the validation until the user has finished typing or modifying the input, reducing unnecessary validations and improving performance.
- **Window Resize Events**: In situations where you need to handle window resize events, using the useDebounce hook can help prevent excessive updates and improve performance. Instead of handling the resize event on every pixel change, you can debounce the event handling to trigger only after a certain delay once the user has finished resizing the window.

## Implementation details

The useDebounce hook internally uses the useState and useEffect hooks provided by React. It maintains a debounced value state that gets updated whenever the original value changes. The debounce delay is achieved by utilizing the setTimeout function to trigger the update after the specified delay.

By using the useEffect hook with the debounced value as a dependency, you can ensure that the effect callback is executed only when the debounced value changes.

## TypeScript Support

The useDebounce hook has built-in support for TypeScript and provides typechecking and autocompletion when used in TypeScript projects.

## Troubleshooting

The debounced value is not updating as expected

If the debounced value is not updating as expected, ensure that you are correctly passing the value and delay arguments to the useDebounce hook. Verify that the dependencies of the useEffect hook are set correctly to trigger the desired behavior.

Additionally, make sure that the component where you are using the useDebounce hook is mounted and rendered properly.

## Conclusion

The useDebounce custom hook is a powerful tool for optimizing performance by debouncing values in React applications. It allows you to control the delay period and reduces unnecessary computations or API calls triggered by rapid value changes. By incorporating the useDebounce hook into your
