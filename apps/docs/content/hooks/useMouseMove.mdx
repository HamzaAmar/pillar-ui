## Why useMouseMove

The useMouseMove hook provides an easy way to track the mouse position within a React component. It returns the current mouse position and an event handler to update the position when the mouse moves.

## Installation

To use the useMouseMove hook, simply import it into your React component:

```tsx
import { useMouseMove } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'
```

## Returned Values

The useMouseMove hook returns an object with the following properties and methods:

- `position: MousePosition`: An object with `x` and `y` properties representing the current mouse coordinates.
- `onMouseMove: (event: MouseEvent) => void`: An event handler to update the mouse position when the mouse moves.

## Usage

To use the useMouseMove hook, call it inside your functional component:

```tsx
import { useMouseMove } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const { position, onMouseMove } = useMouseMove()

  return (
    <div onMouseMove={onMouseMove}>
      {' '}
      Mouse position: {position.x}, {position.y}{' '}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, the `useMouseMove` hook is used to track and display the current mouse position in the component. The `position` property holds the current coordinates with `x` and `y` properties, while the `onMouseMove` event handler updates the position when the mouse moves.

## Implementation details

The useMouseMove hook uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the mouse position. It updates the position by attaching the `onMouseMove` event handler to the component using the `onMouseMove` prop.

## TypeScript Support

The useMouseMove hook has built-in TypeScript support and includes type definitions for the returned values.

## Conclusion

The useMouseMove hook is a convenient way to track the mouse position within a React component. Whether you need to display the position or perform other actions based on the mouse movement, this hook provides a simple and straightforward solution.
