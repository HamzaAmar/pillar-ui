## Why useClickOutside

Managing click outside events can be a common task in React applications, and this hook provides an easy way to handle it in a consistent and reusable way.

## Installation

To use useClickOutside in your project, you can install it from npm:

npm install --dev @pillar-ui/hooks

## Usage

To use the useClickOutside hook in your React components, import it and call it in your functional component like this:

```tsx title='app.tsx' showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useClickOutside } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'

function App() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false)

  const handleOutsideClick = () => {
    setOpen(false)
  }

  const outsideRef = useClickOutside(handleOutsideClick)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle Menu</button>
      {isOpen && (
        <div ref={outsideRef} style={{ border: '1px solid black', padding: '10px' }}>
          Click outside this box to close the menu.
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## How It Works

The useClickOutside hook attaches a ref to the specified DOM element. It then listens for click events on the entire document. When a click event occurs, the hook checks if the event's target is outside the element referenced by the ref. If it's outside, the provided handler function is executed.

## Use Case

The useClickOutside hook can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

- Toggling the visibility of an element when the user clicks outside of it.
- Closing a modal when the user clicks outside of it.
- Hiding a menu when the user clicks outside of it.
- Preventing the user from clicking on elements that they are not supposed to click on.

## Implementation details

The useClickOutside hook uses the useRef and useEffect hooks from the React library to manage the boolean state value and update functions respectively.

## TypeScript Support

This hook is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for its usage

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues using the useClickOutside hook, please refer to the documentation or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

The useClickOutside custom hook is a useful tool for adding click outside functionality to your React application. By using this hook, you can make your app more accessible and improve the user experience for your users.
