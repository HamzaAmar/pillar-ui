# useBooleanState

## Introduction

The useBooleanState hook is a custom hook for managing a boolean state value. It returns an object containing the current boolean value and functions for updating it.

## Why useBooleanState

Managing boolean state values can be a common task in React applications, and this hook provides an easy way to handle it in a consistent and reusable way.

## Installation

To use useBooleanState in your project, you can install it from npm:

```tsx
npm install --dev '@pillar/hooks'
```

## Usage

To use the useBooleanState hook in your React components, import it and call it in your functional component like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Alert.tsx"
import { useBooleanState } from '@pillar/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const { booleanValue, setTrue, setFalse, setToggle } = useBooleanState()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current value: {booleanValue.toString()}</p>
      <button onClick={setTrue}>Set true</button>
      <button onClick={setFalse}>Set false</button>
      <button onClick={setToggle}>Toggle value</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can optionally pass in a boolean value as the default value when calling the useBooleanState hook:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Alert.tsx"
const { booleanValue, setTrue, setFalse, setToggle } = useBooleanState(true)
```

## Use Case

- **Toggling a menu or modal**: You can use useBooleanState to manage the state of a menu or modal that is toggled by a button click.

- **Managing the state** of a checkbox or toggle switch: If you have a checkbox or toggle switch in your UI, you can use useBooleanState to manage its state.

- **Controlling the visibility of an element**: You can use useBooleanState to manage the visibility of an element based on a boolean value. For example, you could use it to show or hide a tooltip when a user hovers over an element.

- **Conditional rendering**: You can use useBooleanState to conditionally render components based on a boolean value. For example, you could use it to conditionally render a "Save" button only when a form has been edited.

- **Managing the state of a feature flag**: If you have a feature flag in your application that determines whether a certain feature is enabled or not, you can use useBooleanState to manage the state of the flag. This allows you to easily toggle the feature on and off as needed.

## Implementation details

The useBooleanState hook uses the useState and useCallback hooks from the React library to manage the boolean state value and update functions respectively.

## TypeScript Support

This hook is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for its usage

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues using the useBooleanState hook, please refer to the documentation or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

The useDarkMode custom hook is a useful tool for adding dark mode functionality to your React application. By using this hook, you can make your app more accessible and improve the user experience for your users.
