## Why useHover

The useHover hook simplifies the process of tracking the hover state of an element in a React application. It provides an easy-to-use interface for handling hover events and accessing the current hover state.

## Installation

To use the useHover hook, simply import it into your React component:

```ts
import { useHover } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'
```

## Returned Values

The useHover hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `hoverHandlers`: An object containing the event handlers for `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events. These event handlers should be spread onto the element you want to track the hover state for.
- `isHovered`: A boolean value representing the current hover state of the element. It will be `true` when the element is being hovered, and `false` otherwise.

## Usage

To use the useHover hook, call it inside your functional component like so:

```tsx
import { useHover } from '@pillar-ui/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const { hoverHandlers, isHovered } = useHover()

  return <div {...hoverHandlers}> {isHovered ? 'Hovered' : 'Not Hovered'} </div>
}
```

In the example above, the `useHover` hook is used to track the hover state of a `div` element. The `hoverHandlers` object is spread onto the `div` element to attach the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers. The `isHovered` variable is used to conditionally render the text based on the current hover state.

## Implementation details

The useHover hook uses the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks from React to manage the hover state and handle hover events. It updates the hover state based on the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events triggered by the element.

## TypeScript Support

The useHover hook is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for its return values.

## Conclusion

The useHover hook simplifies the process of tracking the hover state of an element in a React application. By handling the complex work of managing the hover state and providing event handlers, this hook allows you to easily add interactivity based on hover events.
