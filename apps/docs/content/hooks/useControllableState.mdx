# useControllableState

## Introduction

The useControllableState hook creates a state variable that can be either controlled or uncontrolled.

## Why useControllableState

This hook is useful for creating stateful components that need to handle controlled and uncontrolled scenarios.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @pillar/hooks
yarn add @pillar/hooks
```

## Usage

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Alert.tsx"
import { useControllableState } from '@pillar/hooks'

function MyComponent({ controlledValue, defaultValue }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useControllableState({ controlledValue, defaultValue })
  // ...
}
```

## Implementation details

The hook returns an array containing the current value and a setter function. If controlledValue is defined, the hook returns it and a setter function that updates it. If controlledValue is not defined, the hook returns a state variable initialized to defaultValue and a setter function that updates it.

## TypeScript Support

This hook is fully typed and supports TypeScript out of the box.
