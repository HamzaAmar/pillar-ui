## 📝 Current Functionality:

First off, let's understand what we're trying to improve. Can you give a detailed description of the feature or functionality you wish to improve? Let's get a complete picture: what it does, how it works, and where one can find it in the project.

## 🚀 Proposed Enhancement:

Now the fun part, improvement time! What could we do better? What changes are you proposing? Try to be as specific as you can.

## 🔍 Rational Behind Your Proposal:

Here's a chance to convince us. Why should we implement your proposed changes? What's the benefit? Remember, it's beneficial not only to tell us why it's a good idea, but why it's better than what we have now.

## 🎯 Potential Implementation:

Do you have technical insights? Can you propose a way to implement these changes? Don't worry if you can't – your ideas are valuable either way!

## 🌳 Impact on the Project:

Let's look ahead. How will your improvement affect the project overall? The user experience? Are there any areas of the project that will be particularly affected or require changes?

## 📂 Improvement Location:

If your improvement relates to a specific file or component within the project, please specify its location:

- [ ] @pillar-ui/core
- [ ] @pillar-ui/hooks
- [ ] @pillar-ui/utils
- [ ] @pillar-ui/icons

## 📚 Needful Resources (Optional):

If you have any references or additional materials which can help us understand your proposal better, do share!
