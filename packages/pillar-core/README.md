## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using Pillar Core in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Create a new project or navigate to your existing project directory in the terminal.

1. Install the Pillar Core package by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @pillar-ui/core

```

Or Yarn

```bash
yarn add @pillar-ui/core
```

### Adding Styles

To enhance the appearance and maintain visual consistency of your application using Pillar components, follow these steps to add the necessary styles. Pillar provides a CSS file that not only enhances the styling but also introduces additional features such as dark mode support and right-to-left (RTL) language support.

1. Open the root file of your project.

1. Locate the file where your application is initialized, typically named App.js, App.tsx, or similar.

1. Import the Pillar CSS file by adding the following import statement at the top of the file:

```tsx
import '@pillar-ui/core/main.css'
```

This import statement ensures that the necessary styles are applied to the Pillar components used in your application.

### Customizing Theming

With Pillar UI, you can easily customize the appearance of your user interface (UI) to match your preferences. By modifying the predefined custom properties, you can control colors, typography, spacing, and more.

To change the primary color of your UI, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a file named theme.css or any other preferred name.

1. Inside theme.css, define the desired primary color using the `--Pcolor` custom property. For example:

```css
:root {
  --Pcolor: #ff0000; /* Replace with your desired primary color */
}
```

You can customize other aspects of the theme by modifying additional custom properties. Refer to the Pillar Core documentation for a full list of available custom properties and their usage.

1. Save the `theme.css` file.

1. Import the `theme.css` file in your project, making sure to import it after the `@pillar-ui/core/main.css` import. This ensures that your custom styles override the default styles provided by Pillar Core. For example:

```tsx
import '@pillar-ui/core/style'
import './theme.css'
```

By following these steps, you can easily personalize the primary color of your UI to your preferred choice. Feel free to explore other customization options such as font size, shadows, gradients, and spacing, which can be adjusted using similar custom properties.

Pillar Core empowers you to create a visually appealing UI that aligns with your project requirements and brand identity. Enjoy the flexibility and control over your UI's appearance with Pillar Core's customization capabilities.
